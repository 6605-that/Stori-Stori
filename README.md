Repo Naming Structure
 type: subject e.g body, footer
The title consists of the type of the message and subject. The type is contained within the title and can be one of these types:
 feat/ a new feature
 fix/ a bug fix
 docs/ changes to documentation
 style/ formatting, missing semi colons, etc; no code change
 refactor/ refactoring production code
 test/ adding tests, refactoring test; no production code change
 chore/ updating build tasks, package manager configs, etc; no production code change
An example of a good branch name
 feat/Make-login-check-for-email-and-password

More detailed explanatory text, if necessary. Wrap it to about 72 characters or so. In some contexts, the first line is treated as the subject of the commit and the rest of the text as the body. The blank line separating the summary from the body is critical (unless you omit the body entirely); various tools like log, shortlog and rebase can get confused if you run the two together. Explain the problem that this commit is solving. Focus on why you are making this change as opposed to how (the code explains that). Are there side effects or other unintuitive consequenses of this change? Here's the place to explain them.
 Further paragraphs come after blank lines.
 Bullet points are okay, too
 Typically a hyphen or asterisk is used for the bullet, preceded by a single space, with blank lines in between, but conventions vary here
